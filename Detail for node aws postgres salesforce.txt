1) Create NodeJs api 
   by which we can insert data into PostGreSQL and other operation also 

.  We create to index file first for test on local server and second one is for deployment in     aws 
.  We create Lambda function in AWS and create Zip file for our nodeJS code and upload Zip in     aws 
.  Then we Test our index file for all operation that it work or not in aws 

   EVENT JSON
	{
          "route": "fetch",
          "query": {
             "limit": 1,
             "offset": 0,
             "sortBy": "id",
             "sortOrder": "desc"
            }
         }

	 {
           "route": "insert"
         }

          {
            "route": "deleteUser/{id}",
            "id": "$input.params('id')"
           }


          {
            "route": "updateUser/{id}",
            "id": "$input.params('id')"
           }


	

.  Some Steps we must do in aws for test or run the code 
   some permitions are also given to lambda function

   go to configuration / vpc

   1) VPC
    . vpc-3fed8b54 (172.31.0.0/16) | Default

   2) Subnets

   . Allow IPv6 traffic = false
   . subnet-0df25a0fdbf7c972d (172.31.112.0/20) | us-east-2b, private-subnet-lambda

   3) Security groups
      .sg-0f2084e86baad56ac (solved-rds-prod)


   * in search bar search IAM then go to Roles like then search which permistion requried 
     which is show when test in aws

  * for checking logs in aws 

	


 
2) Now We Create Api endpoint which is availabe in api getWay
. then we go to api getway 
  we select which type of api we want to create like (get, post, delete, update )
  then we also provide application/json in 
. now we use that api in any where like we can use it in postmen 



3) Now we can insert that data which is available in postgres into Salesforce 
.  by using api endpoint we can fetch postgres data into apex code and insert into salesforce    databse with the help of batch class
